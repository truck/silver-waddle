LD 37  - One Room
----

Code for LD 37.

Roguelike, I wonder how we'll figure out the 'one room' thing.

Dream - apartment, my room was swapped out for another.

maybe build game on concept of one room in apartment complex is robbed, and
you have to figure out which one before they strike again?

also had idea before that of having a single room where people came into,
and you had to convince them/teach them/pick one? for something?

Team of heroes to go on mission?
